<h1> Step 2. The Marketing Plan</h1>
<img src="images/funnel.jpg" style="text-align:center">
<p>Each analysis does more than establish a baseline which can be used to measure the 
success of future initiatives. Every analysis also includes a Marketing Plan identifying 
specific areas for improvement, or new initiatives which could be implemented. Every 
marketing plan is tailored to match the business and is based on existing marketing 
budget, current marketing activities, and future goals.</p>

<p>Marketing Plans determine which areas of a business need the most improvement: 
<ul>
<li>Traffic to Site</li>
<li>Conversions on Site</li>
<li>Repeat Business.</li>
</ul>
Based on the conclusions each marketing plan recommends one or more actions which can be implemented quickly and affordably after the analysis.</p>

<p>Zoovy's unique approach maximizes return-on-investment and ensures the necessary 
fuel for future business growth. A limited number of analysis are available each month – 
so contact a Zoovy business development specialist today to get started. </p>
