Zoovy is the first platform to include a true Business Intelligence (BI) component – further demonstrating our commitment to being the best one-solution e-commerce platform. Until now, business intelligence functionality was only available to the largest retailers. Zoovy's BI application is part of our standard desktop offering, giving robust business intelligence features to merchants of any size. Zoovy's Integrated Desktop provides a single, high-speed interface where back-office functions such as warehousing, inventory, order and risk management are all easily accessible and managed. Because Zoovy's Integrated Desktop is a desktop application, running out of storage space or taking a long time to perform tasks is not an issue. Zoovy's Business Intelligence application seamlessly integrates: reporting, analytics, online analytical processing, data mining, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining and predictive analytics. The robust business intelligence capabilities that come standard in Zoovy allow merchants to make more data-driven and better informed business decisions.</p>
