SAN DIEGO - August 7, 2001 - Zoovy, Inc. today announced that it has gained 10,000 trial customers in the past month, demonstrating the strong demand for its online storefront services.  Zoovy provides software and services that offer a complete online selling system for merchants.  In addition to an online store with payment and fulfillment, Zoovy's suite of software tools include auction integration, automated customer relationship management and access to industry experts.

"The overwhelming response we have received demonstrates that we have what businesses are looking for," said David Steel, CEO. "By making it easy for businesses to attract and retain customers online, we help them to dramatically increase online revenue."
<P>
Zoovy's comprehensive and affordable offerings include many unique features.  With Auction Launcher, small businesses can automate auctions on sites such as eBay and bring the winning bidder to their storefront for more selling opportunities.  Automated Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools enable customized e-mail promotions to drive repeat sales.  Order Manager software is a Windows-based program that helps businesses update and manage orders and content offline, with a synchronized update to the web site.  Zoovy also offers access to industry specialists by phone to help small merchants make the most of their online marketing strategy.

"Zoovy takes a lot of the work out of running the online business," said Kathy Kilna, owner of Kathy Kilna's Creations.  "I just make the product and sell it.  It's important for me to offer options to my customers, and Zoovy makes it easy to customize.  I have almost tripled my sales since I've used Zoovy."

Zoovy's three online storefront solutions include Zoovy Merchant, Zoovy FastTrack and Zoovy Developer.  Prices range from $19.95 to $99.95 per month, depending on the level of features and support, plus a one-time set-up charge.
