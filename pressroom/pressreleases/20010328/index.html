			<!-- PRESS RELEASE body -->
			<p>SAN DIEGO, Calif., March 28, 2001 -Zoovy puts small businesses online with their flagship e-commerce product, Zoovy Merchant. The product includes a store-builder, hosting, credit card processing, and more. Zoovy Merchant is a comprehensive offering for small businesses that need the flexibility to operate their business in their own unique way, without having to worry about integrating the products of several different companies.</p>
			<p>As part of its ongoing development Zoovy is the first e-commerce software to integrate with Western Union's MoneyZap service. MoneyZap is a free service for individuals and businesses that need instantly and securely send and receive money through their checking accounts. MoneyZap effectively provides small businesses with an easy and inexpensively alternative to credit cards. "These are the ideal payment services for small to medium sized businesses" said David Steel CEO of Zoovy, Inc.</p>
			<p>Both Western Union MoneyZap and Zoovy are both targeting the Auction crowd. MoneyZap is trying to get an edge on the popular PayPal payment system, which is firmly entrenched in the Auction space. As part of its offering Zoovy helps new online businesses develop a customer base by leveraging traffic from sites such as eBay, Amazon, and Yahoo. When the auction is over the Zoovy software can automatically contact the winning bidders and accept payment at the storefront. "Zoovy already supports credit card processing, however many small businesses are not comfortable with accepting credit cards online, this is why integrating features like Western Union Money Zap into our product is so important" explained Steel.</p>
