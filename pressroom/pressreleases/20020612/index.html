<P>
SAN DIEGO, June 12, 2002 -- Zoovy, Inc., an auction management and e-commerce company that empowers businesses to reach dynamic online markets and increase sales, finalized an agreement with uBid, a leading retail auction and e-commerce marketplace and majority-owned operating company of CMGI, Inc. (NASDAQ: CMGI). The agreement enables merchants using Zoovy to effortlessly sell products at uBid, drawing exposure from a sophisticated user base. 
<P>
"This agreement provides our merchants with an incredible opportunity to maximize their online presence," said David Steel, CEO of Zoovy. "uBid has a large user base looking for bargains on brand name merchandise, as well as an extensive offering in the computers and consumer electronics categories.  There was no question in our mind that uBid was a 'must have' for our merchants." 
<P>
As e-marketplace experts, Zoovy works with companies to formulate a strategy to quickly increase online sales. Overstocked, returned or unsold inventory is introduced to millions currently buying through dynamic-pricing channels such as uBid, thus significantly increasing inventory turnover.
<P>
Christian Feuer, uBid president and chief executive officer, added "uBid's relationship with Zoovy furthers our goal to offer exceptional value to our customers as we are able to offer them even more brand name products to choose from, while providing Zoovy's merchants with access to uBid's sizable and targeted audience. Zoovy's merchants have already begun utilizing our services and have told us that they appreciate the ease of selling products through uBid's Consumer Exchange where no listing fees are charged."

<P>

<i><tiny>This release contains forward-looking statements which address a variety of subjects including, for example, the expected benefits of the agreement with Zoovy and the expected ability of uBid to auction products.
