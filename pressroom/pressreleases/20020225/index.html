<P>
SAN DIEGO- Zoovy Inc., a pioneer in e-commerce storefronts, and ePier.com, a rising player in the online auction field, announced a strategic partnership to bring eight hundred Zoovy merchants to a growing auction community at ePier.  These online merchants use the Zoovy system for storefront and auction management.  ePier joins the ranks of auction heavyweights- eBay, Yahoo Auctions, and Amazon, as venues for Zoovy merchants to place products. This feature is available now for Zoovy account-holders, who are attracted to ePier for its free listing (auction placement) and reasonable final value fees. 
<P>
"ePier is a very important part of our long term strategy for letting our Enterprise customers sell through a variety of marketplaces, we're very happy to have them on board," said David Steel, CEO of Zoovy, Inc.
<P>
The ePier auctions fully support Zoovy technology; auctions are created on the Zoovy site from the product in the merchant's Zoovy store, sent to ePier and similar marketplaces, and closed back at the merchant's Zoovy website. The merchant can manage the auction online at the Zoovy website, or offline in a Windows application.
