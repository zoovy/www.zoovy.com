			<!-- PRESS RELEASE body -->
			<p>SAN DIEGO - June 6, 2001 - Zoovy Inc., today announced the availability of its suite of software tools that offer small business owners the fastest, easiest way to build a custom online store, enabling them to begin selling products in several hours. Zoovy's products and services, which include Web site design and hosting, e-commerce shopping cart, online marketing, auction integration, customer relationship management (CRM), content management and fulfillment, are the first to incorporate advanced features previously unavailable to - or affordable for - small business owners looking to obtain new customers, drive online sales and increase customer retention. </p>
			<p>"By providing comprehensive, affordable Web storefront solutions designed to generate sales, Zoovy gives small business owners all the tools they need to grow their businesses online," said David Steel, CEO of Zoovy. "Early discussions with industry experts, strategic partners and trial customers have been promising; we are confident that Zoovy's well-built, reliable product offerings - supported by our live customer support staff - give small business owners the competitive edge they are looking for." </p>
			<p>According to a recent study conducted by Vernon Keenan, founder of leading Web industry analyst firm Keenan Vision, the number of e-merchants (small business owners operating online stores) will increase to 2.6 million in 2004, up from only 70,000 in 1999. Zoovy has the right product offering and is poised to take a leadership role in the significant emerging industry that is expected to supply $49 billion in services for e-merchants in 2004.</p>
			<p>Two key components of Zoovy's offerings are Auction Integration and Order Manager. Auction Integration enables merchants to generate traffic and sales by placing their products on popular auction sites such as eBay, Yahoo and Amazon. Zoovy is the only Web service capable of bringing winning bidders directly from auction sites into their individual online stores to receive instant payment and increase cross-sell opportunities. Zoovy's Order Manager, which offers a toolset comparable to those used by many large companies, enables order and customer management, as well as storage of all order history and customer/prospect correspondence. This unique windows application saves time for the business owner since it is far easier and faster than working in a web browser, and also generates more professional looking invoices, labels and packing slips.</p>
			<p>The Zoovy architecture provides an unparalleled level of reliability and scalability, no matter how quickly a business grows. With Zoovy's wide range of storefront templates, small business owners can not only build, market and operate their online stores entirely in-house, but also make rapid changes to their stores at any time for seasonal themes or special promotions.</p>
			<p>Zoovy offers small businesses and Web developers three products within the company's suite of online storefront solutions: </p>
			<li><b>Zoovy Merchant ™&trade;</b>  - a comprehensive, do-it-yourself e-commerce package.</li><br>
			<li><b>Zoovy FastTrack &trade; </b>™ - provides a team of Web professionals who build and manage the online store for the small businessperson.</li><br>
			<li><B>Zoovy Developer ™&trade;</b>  - designed for companies that need to incorporate an e-commerce system into their existing Web sites.</li><br>
			<p><b>Pricing and Availability</b></p>
			<p>Zoovy Merchant, FastTrack and Developer are offered from $19.95 to $104.95 per month depending on the level of features and support a company requires, plus a minimal, one-time set-up charge. All Zoovy products are offered with a free 30-day trial and are available at the company's Web site, www.zoovy.com.</p>
