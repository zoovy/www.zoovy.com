<p>Zoovy Inc. has clarified its Auction Information Page which contains detailed information about an auction as well as a link to Zoovy merchant store. 
</p><p>
All auctions placed through Zoovy now have an Auction Information Page. The new policy has three links. Users can choose "Click here to visit my store," "Click here to see when others have visited this auction" or "Click here for important information about this auction." 
</p><p>
"It's a perfect workaround for sellers because they'll actually get more people visiting their Web site than they did before (eBay's) policy change (regarding the placement of hyperlinks in auctions)," said Pinguino Kolb, marketing director for Zoovy Inc. 
</p><p>
Brian Horakh, an independent auction seller, agreed. 
</p><p>
"Creative links require you to develop a bona-fide reason why bidders ought to come back to your site," he said. "It may not be obvious at first but the creative link will be your competitive edge. It will be the reason people bid/buy from you. 
</p><p>
"Of course just like sellers, competitive edges come in all shapes and sizes. Some creative links may simply go to an intelligent graph that shows auction activity by the hour, for others it might link to an active message board where bidders can ask questions, and discuss your auctions."
