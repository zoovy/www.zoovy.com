<p>In its continuing effort to target the online auction community, Zoovy, Inc. has integrated with Western Union's MoneyZap service. 
</p><p>
MoneyZap is a free service for consumers and businesses that need to instantly and securely send and receive money through their checking accounts. It is billed by MoneyZap as an inexpensive alternative to credit cards. 
</p><p>
"These are the ideal payment services for small to medium sized businesses," said David Steel, CEO of Zoovy, Inc. 
</p><p>
As part of its content, Zoovy is helping new online businesses develop a customer base by leveraging traffic from sites such as eBay, Amazon and Yahoo! When the auction is over, the Zoovy software can automatically contact the winning bidders and accept payment at the storefront. 
</p><p>
"Zoovy already supports credit card processing, however many small businesses are not comfortable with accepting credit cards online," Steel said. "This is why integrating features like Western Union MoneyZap into our product is so important."
