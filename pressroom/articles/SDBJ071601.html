Starting at a time when the B2B Internet industry looks as inviting as a
romp through a Bosnian minefield, Cardiff startup Zoovy says all is groovy.
When we launched last month, I was hoping wed have about 1,000 trial
accounts, but as of last week we had about 7,000 signed up, said founder
and CEO David Steel.
<P>
Zoovy designs, creates and maintains e-commerce Web sites powered by an
applications software that Steel says is superior to his competitors, and
which has been a year-and-a-half in the making. Our focus is on customer
relationship management, and increasing sales, said Steel, who managed the
city of Escondidos information systems for five years. We help merchants
not only place their products on a Web site, but we place those products on
auction sites and other e-commerce sites as well.
<P>
Steel founded Zoovy in January 2000 with about $600,000 in capital,
primarily from friends and family. This January it obtained $1.5 million in
equity funding from American Pinnacle, a Los Angeles-based technology VC.
We really dont need that much (funding) because weve been able to keep
our monthly burn rate down, have an excellent business plan and great team
of people, Steel said.
<P>
Right now, Zoovy has eight full-time staffers, supplemented by eight
contract employees, but it will soon add another four to its payroll. Within
a year, the number could easily grow to 100, he said. Revenues are already 
flowing, and the break-even point is in sight, estimated to be somewhere in
the first quarter of next year.
<P>
The company name doesnt mean anything; its just a catchy sound, says
Steel. To find an available domain name he had his programmer conducted a
search for available domain names with a lot of vowels. Zoovy was among the
words and sounded like a winner.
