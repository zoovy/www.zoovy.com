<p>eBay's decision to revise its hyperlink policy has caused considerable unrest among online auction users. That has led other auction sites to try and take advantage of the grumbling and lure unsatisfied users to their sites. 
</p><p>
Yahoo! Auctions sent an e-mail to its users this week, reminding them it allows sellers to post links in their auctions. 
</p><p>
"Our site is an open network," said Yahoo! Auctions spokesman Rich Godwin. "We allow people to link, as long as it's legal, from their auctions to their storefronts. Hopefully, they are Yahoo! stores, but a lot of the time they're not and that's fine with us. This is one of the benefits we've had for a long time." 
</p><p>
Yahoo! Auctions isn't the only online site hoping its link policy will attract frustrated eBay users. Zoovy Inc. made a point this week of promoting its "Auction Information Page" which features more information about the product, a graph detailing traffic for that particular item and a link back to its Web Store. 
</p><p>
"Linking from the auction to the 'Auction Information Page' page is perfectly valid and legal," said Pinguino Kolb, marketing director for Zoovy, Inc. "Bidders cannot buy the auction item directly from the merchant on the page; they must win the eBay auction. 
</p><p>
"The statistics generated by this page have proven to generate more excitement from bidders. Excitement and hype directly correlates to bigger and better bids. Also, the additional information on the page gives serious bidders more information about the product they want." 
</p><p>
Whether eBay users are frustrated enough to explore other online options remains to be seen. It's clear, however, the competition is prepared to do what it can to capitalize on the unrest eBay's new policy has created. 
</p><p>
"We want people to create their business on our platform and make it a total commerce solution for them," Godwin said. "If that means a link to other areas to help buyers and sellers make better business decisions, then we're all for that." </p>
