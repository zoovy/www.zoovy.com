<p>Sometimes negative publicity can turn out positive. </p>

<p>Take the example of Zoovy.com, a Cardiff-based provider of e-business software. Earlier this month, the company was lambasted on the notorious Web site, F***ed Company.com, which regularly skewers troubled dot-coms and high-tech firms. The original posted message reported the firm’s investors had pulled out, causing heavy layoffs. </p>

<p>Turns out the post was overblown: investors haven’t yanked funding, and only four staffers were cut, reducing headcount from 25 to 21, said Zoovy CEO David Steel. To add insult to injury, the layoffs took place about four months earlier. </p>

<p>In response, Steel’s partner posted a message on the site correcting the first post, and included a 5-megabit video featuring Steel swimming in a lagoon in front of his staffers. </p>

<p>Steel said he took the dip with some kids’ water wings attached to his body, making good on a promise to do so if his sales staff hit their goal of $150,000 for the preceding month. </p>

<p>The video of Steel’s swim was accompanied by the song, “I’m Too Sexy.” </p>

<p>Over the next few days, the video was downloaded over 16,000 times, and prompted at least 500 free trials of Zoovy’s software. </p>

<p>“I was amazed at the amount of traffic the video generated, and all the attention that I got because of it,” said Steel. </p>

<p>But Steel’s embarrassment turned to joy when the site retracted its initial criticism and made amends by giving the firm what amounts to a thumbs up. </p>

<p>“We’re the first company to go from a ‘f***ed company to a lucked company,” he said. </p>

<p>Steel said the attention may result in new customers, but so far Zoovy’s doing just groovy, having reached operating profitability in July. It’s on track to reach $2.5 million in sales by the end of this year, he said. </p>

<p>While Zoovy went through a little contraction earlier this year and reduced its office space, it re-hired three of the four Web site developers it cut earlier, and now has 18 full-time workers. It also uses about a dozen independent contractors both in San Diego and Florida for various projects, Steel said. </p>

<p>“The biggest thing is that we’re in the black on a cash flow basis today,” he said. </p>
