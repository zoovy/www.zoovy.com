<h1>Apprentice Sith Lord</h1><br>
<h3>Job Description:</h3>		
<p>An unexpected position has opened up in the Dark Side Consulting Group for an Apprentice Sith Lord.  The ideal candidate for this position would like galactic travel and possess a complete understanding of, and competence with, the Force or demonstrate a willingness to learn.
</p><p>
<h3>Duties include:</h3>
<p>Performing competitive intelligence, hands-on intervention in support of the Sith Master's planning initiatives, ability to travel the galaxy widely, and operating a variety of laser-powered hand weapons and high-powered space/air vehicles. Some slaying of enemies of the Dark Side is also required, which may be performed using the Force or hand weapons.
</p><p>
Qualified applicants would possess good communication skills (especially when speaking in menacing whispers) and would be action-oriented individuals and risk takers.   A background in study of the Force (light side or dark) is desirable, as would typically be acquired by those with advanced degrees or significant course work in Jedi Arts from the Jedi Academy of Coruscant.
</p><p>
Applicants should also be familiar with holographic projection equipment, possess a valid galactic pilot's license (for all classes of ships), and must show a willingness to give in to their hate.   A proven track record of using fear and/or Jedi mind tricks to control others is also desirable, as is the ability to speak several galactic languages.   Ideal candidates for this position would also have no children or other living relatives who are strong in the ways of the Force.  (A new hire would be given several weeks to meet this requirement.)
</p><p>
Compensation for this position is commensurate with experience, and is extremely competitive for this field. Benefits include a generous severance package, a company starship, and a dark-colored clothing allowance. The Apprentice Sith Lord reports to and works closely with the Sith Master, and experience in such small, team-based organizations is vital to the success of the master's plans.  Discretion is also highly valued, as is the ability to see the future before it happens. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.</p>
