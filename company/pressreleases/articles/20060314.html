<p>March 14, 2006 -- San Diego -- Ecommerce solution provider Zoovy, Inc. announces the release of Order Manager 6.0, which automates the entire order process for eBay® sellers and other ecommerce merchants.</p>

<p>Order Manager 6.0 allows users to print postage, FedEx and UPS air bills right from their computer without having to copy and paste, and automatically sends out tracking information to the buyer. Zoovy’s integration with Intuit’s QuickBooks allows users to synchronize customer and order data with QuickBooks. </p>

<p>&quot;Using Zoovy has made it simpler to get products listed on eBay,&quot; said Andrew Casey, owner of www.877MyJuicer.com, who has an online store and sells products on eBay. &quot;Order Manager synchronizes orders from eBay with our QuickBooks accounting software and allows us to print FedEx air bills automatically from our warehouse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most merchants can handle a few orders a day, but as your business grows you need this level of automation in order to provide the best customer service,&quot; said Zoovy CEO David Steel. &quot;With Order Manager you can expand your business without having to expand your staff.&quot;</p>

<p>The new software provides reporting and customer relations management features to track customer and product information and send automated email notifications. Zoovy Order Manager also provides full payment support, offering a variety of payment options such as PayPal or automatic credit card processing. </p>
