<p>Zoovy, Inc., the leading provider of e-commerce solutions for auction and stand-alone online retailers, announced today a new strategic integration with Overstock.com, the popular online discount retailer and auction site. Zoovy will enable its sellers to bulk list auctions on Overstock.com's marketplace using patent-pending syndication technology.</p>

<p>Zoovy's syndication technology was created to enable high volume sellers the ability to launch auctions and sell products across multiple marketplaces in a completely automated fashion. This proprietary technology is currently available for Zoovy clients selling through eBay auctions, eBay stores, AOL Classifieds, Yahoo Shopping, Froogle, Shopping.com, Bizrate, and now Overstock.com Auctions. David Steel, Zoovy's CEO, stated: &quot;This integration provides Overstock.com Auctions' sellers with the only technology available that combines information and images already in the seller's system with auction starting prices calculated automatically using pricing models predetermined by the seller.&quot; He continued to state, &quot;The difficult process of managing multiple marketplaces is now easier than ever with Zoovy's marketplace syndication technology.&quot;</p>

<p>David Wirtenberg, CEO of Outrageousdiamonds.com, one of the largest online diamond sellers, stated: &quot;We are looking forward to the additional exposure of offering our collection of fine diamond jewelry to Overstock.com customers. Zoovy technology has allowed us to maximize our online exposure and manage our success.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Overstock.com Auctions is thrilled to welcome Zoovy's customers onboard. Zoovy's syndication technology will be a huge asset to our marketplace,&quot; said Holly MacDonald-Korth, VP of Auctions at Overstock.com. </p>
