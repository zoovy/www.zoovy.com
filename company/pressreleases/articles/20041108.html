<strong>Zoovy, Inc. Signs Strategic Partnership with buySAFE</strong><br>
Companies join forces for safer online selling on Zoovy’s complete e-commerce platform<br>

<p>Zoovy, Inc., the only e-commerce software provider dedicated to increasing profitability for online sellers, today announced the company has signed a strategic partnership agreement with buySAFE, Inc., which offers one of the highest levels of protection from online purchase risks.  buySAFE’s credibility seal will be offered to Zoovy’s customers who meet a rigorous qualification standard, giving them significant competitive advantage.  Buyers who purchase from those sellers are then given the confidence of a third party that will guarantee the transaction, making shopping online as safe and secure as any other marketplace.</p>

<p>&quot;This best-of-class partnership completes another step in Zoovy’s pledge as a comprehensive e-commerce solution,&quot; said Zoovy CEO David Steel. &quot;With this agreement, we offer our customers a credibility seal that will provide a sense of confidence to online shoppers that they will receive what they purchase or get their money back.  This is particularly valuable for our non-name-brand sellers.&quot;</p>

<p>buySAFE offers the only service that enables approved sellers to present a credibility seal on their online product listings and issues a surety bond to financially protect the buyer in a transaction.  buySAFE performs a rigorous qualification check on sellers and issues the buySAFE Seal only to the most reputable, trustworthy online merchants.  Once an item is purchased, a surety bond from a trusted financial institution is issued through the buySAFE service. The bond guarantees a refund of the item’s sale price in the event that a bonded seller does not fulfill the terms of the sale. This protects consumers from certain online transaction risks such as fraud, misrepresentation, refund failure and seller default.</p>

<p>&quot;By partnering with Zoovy, buySAFE will create safety and security for thousands of buyers and give a competitive edge to Zoovy’s qualified eBay sellers,&quot; said Jeff Grass, CEO of buySAFE.  &quot;Buyers are often hesitant about purchasing anything online because they never know how trustworthy the person on the other end of the sale is.  buySAFE eliminates that doubt with a mark signifying reliability and a financial guarantee.&quot;</p>

<p>Zoovy’s integrated technology platforms enable online sellers to automate and simplify the entire cycle of their sales process.  In addition, Zoovy was recently named a charter member of eBay’s Certified Provider program.  The program recognizes technology innovators that service eBay sellers and keeps its members up to date on eBay’s newest features and changes.</p>
