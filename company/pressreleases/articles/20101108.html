<p>CARLSBAD, CA--(Marketwire - November 8, 2010) -  Zoovy, the leader in success driven eCommerce software for online businesses, today announced it has achieved Compatible Solutions Certification status from FedEx&trade; and is now offering <a href='http://fedex.com/us/smartpost/' target="_blank">FedEx SmartPost</a> shipping to all of its customers, including merchants shipping less than 500 transactions per day. Making FedEx SmartPost available to Zoovy customers means they now have access to the full FedEx residential shipping portfolio, providing them greater flexibility in shipping options.</p>

<p>An option like FedEx SmartPost can increase the cost of goods margin for small to mid-size eCommerce retailers who offer free shipping, a popular promotional tool that has proven to increase customer loyalty. A recent study from Forrester Research revealed that 61 percent of consumers will buy online more often from retailers that offer a free shipping option.</p>

<p>FedEx SmartPost uses the <a href='http://www.usps.com/' target="_blank">United States Postal Service</a>&reg; (USPS) to deliver packages to residential customers in an efficient, cost-effective way. By utilizing the USPS for final delivery, FedEx SmartPost reaches every U.S. address. FedEx SmartPost minimizes handling and maximizes cost savings for the shipper and end consumer alike. By spending less money on shipping costs, retailers can increase their profit margins.</p>

<p>From its inception, Zoovy has developed an eCommerce platform that makes it easier for their customers to utilize new features that will help build their business and exceed sales goals. When coupled with FedEx shipping solutions, Zoovy allows retailers to automate orders, print high quality shipping labels, and automatically place FedEx tracking numbers directly into the confirmation order e-mail via Zoovy's built-in integrated e-mail system, thus saving time and money and providing a professional appearance for the customer.</p>

<p>According to Zoovy Founder and CEO Brian Horakh, "The great thing about offering FedEx SmartPost to small to mid-size retailers is that it helps to level the playing field with large retailers. An eCommerce company that ships under 500 orders per day with FedEx SmartPost now has the same service available as an eCommerce company that ships 1,000 or 10,000 orders per day."</p>

<p>Founded in 2000, Zoovy provides mid-sized retailers with an eCommerce platform that offers cross channel integration, cutting-edge features and a unique approach to problem solving at a fraction of the cost of alternative solutions.
