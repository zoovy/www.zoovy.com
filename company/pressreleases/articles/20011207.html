<strong>Auction Templates Now Available at Zoovy</strong><br>

<p>Merchants using Zoovy to launch auctions can now add auction templates to their arsenal of e-commerce tools. An auction template is a pre-designed layout for auction items and photos, used on popular sites like eBay and Yahoo Auctions. Auction templates allow the non-technical eBay seller to create impressive auction listings. A well-designed auction will generate more interest than the same item in a plain auction template with picture.
<p>Designs range from traditional and contemporary styles to holiday themes. They can use between one and three images, in a variety of layouts. Sellers may also choose to use custom HTML. The design is tied to a powerful commerce system that automatically launches schedules auctions and manages orders both on the web and off-line. Each auction is saved, and can be easily modified and re-launched. Zoovy is a storefront creation and management tool that uses auctions as a vehicle to drive sales to the storefront.
<p>Jupiter Media Metrix analysts predict that the 2001 holiday online retail and travel sales will reach approximately $11.9 billion; an 11 percent increase over last year's $10.8 billion. eBay topped the rankings as the leading holiday shopping website this year. Zoovy is a tool for merchants to place items from their storefronts directly onto global marketplaces like eBay.
