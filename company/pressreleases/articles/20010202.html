<P>
Web Site: Zoovy.com - http://www.zoovy.com. Although this web site  
has a rather unusual name, I would have to say that I would recommend  
this site to anyone who is looking to engage in ecommerce, especially  
someone who is new to the world of online marketing. 
Why?
<P> 
1. This site has a very nice, clean interface and is easy to  
navigate. By navigate, I mean it didn't take me long at all to find  
out what the site was about, and how it could help me. No fluff, no  
hype, just solutions. 
<P>
So what is this site for? It is an ecommerce solution, especially if  
you are looking to put your business on the World Wide Web. For those  
who don't have a site, Zoovy will build you one from the ground up  
and customize it to your specifications. This includes things like  
shopping carts, a catalog, domain name hosting, and more. Once your  
are set up, Zoovy says it is committed to making your business a  
success with promotion tools and more. 
<P>
Packages start at $20, making it affordable for even us small  
business people. The nice thing about this solution is that you also  
get a free trial, greatly reducing your risk if you aren't happy with  
the solution. 
<P>
Definitely worth taking a look at if you are in the market for a new  
place to put your web site or build a new solution for your business.<br>
Highly Recommended. </p>
