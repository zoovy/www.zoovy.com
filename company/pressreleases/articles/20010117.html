<strong>Zoovy Receives 1.5 Million in Venture Capital</strong><br>

<p>A small company (Zoovy, Inc.) received 1.5 million dollars back in November while other tech companies went under. They have spent well over a year in R&D, keeping their product confidential and refusing media inquiry. On January 1st, Zoovy, Inc. announced the release of their highly secretive flagship product: Zoovy Merchant.</p>

<p>Zoovy Merchant is an e-commerce solution unlike any other, with a fresh approach to online success. Forged by a team of seasoned small business experts and innovative programmers, Zoovy Merchant is designed to give business owners the control and flexibility necessary to operate a successful online store.</p>

<p>&quot;Zoovy Merchant means [that] technology isn't one of my problems, it's a small business owners dream come true&quot; said Greg Littrell, owner of NerdGear, Inc. &quot;It gives me all the features I need now, and with Zoovy I won't have to worry about upgrading later.&quot;</p>

<p>Zoovy has an extremely simple recipe for a small business success. It is the combination of all the possible Internet tools that a business might use, sold as single package at a reasonable price. A robust web-managed backend is fused with optional Windows software. The package is sold using an application service provider business model where the customer 'rents' the software and doesn't pay for upgrades or support. Zoovy seeks synergistic relationships between marketing and technology tools and merges the whole package together for an extremely powerful tool unlike any the Internet has seen before.</p>

Zoovy was designed for these merchants so they can quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively come up-to-speed with the Internet revolution and successfully market their products online,&quot; said David Steel, CEO of Zoovy, Inc.  &quot;Zoovy Merchant is a comprehensive package that makes selling products online very easy.&quot;</p>
