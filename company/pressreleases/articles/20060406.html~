San Diego, CA<br>
<p>April 4, 2006 -- San Diego -- Ecommerce solution provider Zoovy, Inc. announces the first template driven AJAX ecommerce site builder. This technology makes it possible for any company to have a Web 2.0 ecommerce site.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 improves the overall usability of ecommerce sites by increasing the interactivity and speed of online stores. Zoovy’s AJAX software is one of the fastest content management systems on the web. With an improved user interface it’s easier to update content, add/remove product categories, and edit items in an online store.</p>

<p>&quot;Switching to an AJAX based store really helped improve sales by making the shopping experience more user friendly. Customers can shop without having to wait for pages to constantly reload,&quot; said Scott Ingham, owner of Expeditionimports.com. &quot;This change has correlated to a 40% increase in our online sales.&quot;</p>

<p>Zoovy’s AJAX technology combines a number of user enhancements. The software provides better search functionality, so customers can easily find the products they want. The automatic word completion feature cuts down on time and effort while searching, and customers can obtain information about products with much less effort.</p>

<p>&quot;We are seeing a huge shift in the way ecommerce sites operate, and this software puts our users at the forefront of this movement,&quot; said David Steel, CEO of Zoovy, Inc. &quot;The Web 2.0 based Zoovy software is more intuitive, and the sites provide a much better buying experience, which translates into more sales for online merchants.&quot;</p>
