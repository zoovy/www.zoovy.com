<p>At the 2004 eBay Developer Conference, Zoovy announced it received an eBay Star Developer Award in the category of Early Adopter. The Early Adopter award recognizes developers who consistently and rapidly support new eBay features and provides the eBay Developers Program team with valuable feedback.</p>

<p>The eBay Star Developer Awards are presented annually to recognize the talent and dedication of members of the eBay Developers Program. At this year's awards ceremony, eBay also awarded eBay developers for their accomplishments in the categories of Services to the Community and Innovator.</p>

<p>&quot;Zoovy has been an enormous contributor to the eBay Developers Program and consistently the first to adopt our new technology offerings,&quot; said Randy Ching, vice president of platform solutions for eBay.  &quot;Zoovy does a terrific job of communicating the benefits of new functionality to their sellers.&quot;</p>

<p>Zoovy's technology offers everything from basic online auction management services to a Media Package that includes solutions for barcode scanning of UPC codes and ISBN numbers that give media sellers the ability to scan a barcode and automatically launch unique items for sale onto eBay. Sellers with depth of inventory can upload lists of products and inventory counts and Zoovy's technology will create and manage the listing and sale of the entire available inventory. Zoovy's enterprise package additionally offers sellers a complete warehouse management system. All of Zoovy's products are integrated with UPS, FedEx, and Endicia for USPS and Intuit's QuickBooks Pro, Enterprise and Online offerings.</p>
