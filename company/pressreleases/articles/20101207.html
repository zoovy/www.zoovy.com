<strong>Zoovy Enhances E-Commerce Platform.</strong><br />
<strong>New Desktop Client Fully Automates Order, Warehouse and Risk Management Functions.</strong><br />



<p>CARLSBAD, CA--(Marketwire - December 7, 2010) - Zoovy, the leader in success driven e-commerce software for online businesses, has announced a new version of its Zoovy Integrated Desktop. The new application bolsters Zoovy's SaaS-based e-commerce platform and is designed for any small to medium sized e-commerce company that ships more than 50 orders per day. Zoovy's Integrated Desktop provides a single, high-speed interface where back-office functions such as warehousing, inventory, order and risk management are all easily accessible and managed.</p>

<p>Zoovy's e-commerce platform, Zoovy Complete, is a SaaS-based application that offers customers a comprehensive, feature-rich solution. Zoovy is the only hosted e-commerce platform that also includes a desktop application as part of its standard product offering. Users benefit from the performance improvements that come with an installed desktop application, from user interface workflow enhancements to the consolidation of critical back-office functions through a single interface.</p>

<p>Zoovy designed its Integrated Desktop to address the needs of small to medium e-commerce merchants, which are typically very resource constrained. The desktop application enables them to achieve significantly higher productivity levels from existing employees, which directly correlates to higher customer satisfaction, improved customer retention and additional resources freed up for other activities such as blogging and social marketing.</p>

<p>"Zoovy's Integrated Desktop has been a lifesaver for my business," said Bob Mullaney, president of Zephyr Sports. "Because it automates many tasks and makes them available at the click of a button, it has allowed us to do a lot more with fewer resources. I've looked at a variety of other options on the market and no one comes anywhere close to having the functionality that Zoovy provides."</p>

<p>The new version of Zoovy Integrated Desktop offers three new features that make back-office operations more efficient. The new features include Advanced Order Filtering, Fraud Status and Batch Order Processing.</p>

<p>Advanced Order Processing allows staff to quickly filter and group orders based on a variety of properties, such as expedited shipping and payment status, then places those orders into batches for efficient hand-off to the warehouse. Fraud Status separates payment status from fraud status, making it easy to identify the risk level associated with an order, and gives fraud its own workflow, allowing for faster processing. Batch Order Processing groups multiple orders into a batch, then assigns the batch to an employee for processing, allowing warehouse staff to quickly pick, pack and ship batches based on notes and priorities. This feature includes a real-time dashboard of employee progress so that supervisors are kept up to date at all times.</p>

<p>According to Zoovy Founder and CEO Brian Horakh, "Our Integrated Desktop application makes critical functions of an e-commerce business more efficient and effective. Merchants using our desktop client have a user experience that is unmatched with any other e-commerce solution on the market. Zoovy Integrated Desktop is automated, fully integrated and customizable. A Zoovy merchant typically realizes a 30 percent increase in employee productivity. The result is a highly scalable and automated solution that saves many hours of work at a low cost of ownership. Merchants can concentrate on driving business with promotions, social media or analytic analysis rather than shipping product."</p>

<p>The new edition of the Zoovy Integrated Desktop is built on the Microsoft.Net framework and can be installed on any Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 computer. Included with Zoovy Complete, the desktop application features a user-friendly interface and receives data from all sales channels including multiple websites like eBay, Amazon, Buy.com, Newegg, HSN, EDI and more. The new desktop application provides native integration with hardware such as thermal label printers and barcode scanners that are not possible via a Web browser. Zoovy Integrated Desktop is also fully integrated with Intuit's Quickbook solutions and automatically syncs and populates with new orders as they are received.</p>
