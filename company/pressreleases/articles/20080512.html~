San Diego, CA<br />
<p>May 12, 2008 -- San Diego -- To help alleviate the high costs of carrier insurance, Zoovy, Inc. a leader in e-Commerce technology has formed a strategic partnership with U-PIC Insurance services. U-PIC is an insurance provider offering full coverage for packages shipped through most major carriers, while offering substantial discounts ranging up to 80% off competitor pricing. Zoovy merchants are now able to take advantage of this service to decrease their operational costs and thus increase overall profit.</p>


<p>U-PIC has a dedicated staff with over nineteen years experience in application and claims processing, and have been a partner of the United States Postal Service for many of those years. By utilizing a streamlined insurance program with U-PIC, Zoovy merchants can eliminate unnecessary carrier trips, as well as non-revenue producing tasks from employees.</p>

<p>&quot;Why pay the high cost of carrier provided insurance, when you could just ship with the carrier and insure your package with U-PIC at a discount?&quot; says Jordan Kohler, &quot;Zoovy's U-PIC integration provides substantial savings on insurance for shippers using UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL and most other carriers. And there are no minimum requirements. Whether you ship hundreds of packages a day or just want to insure that special package once a year, U-PIC has a program to meet everyone’s needs.&quot;</p>
