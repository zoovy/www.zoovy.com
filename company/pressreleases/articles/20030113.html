<p>Zoovy, Inc., the leading provider of auction-management and e-commerce solutions, today announced it has partnered with AllDropShip.com to create a unique and revolutionary new online marketplace.  For the first time, virtually anyone can open an online store and sell products distributed for them by a consortium of drop ship partners who provide the products, manage the inventory and shipping.</p>
<p>With a single click merchants can load products, and images from their suppliers catalogs into their Zoovy store. All Drop Ship then handles the real-time sharing of information such as inventory and calculation of shipping charges. When orders are placed the All Drop Ship system will electronically separate and transmit the products to their respective suppliers, and subsequently remit tracking information back into the merchant's store. The entire process is designed to be highly efficient and accurate for both the Merchant and Supplier. Using All Drop Ship with a Zoovy Store merchants can also sell their own products in conjunction with those that are managed with All Drop Ship.</p>
<p>Zoovy's data integration with AllDropShip.com allows this new generation of e-commerce customer to manage all aspects of their online business and to participate quickly and efficiently in dynamic marketplaces such as eBay, Yahoo and Amazon. Zoovy will provide AllDropShip.com customers with an e-commerce and auction management platform that allows merchants to launch, track, manage and process sales through the virtual distribution network.</p>
<p>&quot;We are proud to serve as the technological foundation of AllDropShip.com,&quot; said David Steel, CEO of Zoovy, Inc.  &quot;AllDropShip.com represents another important step in the development of eCommerce as an open marketplace, available to everyone.&quot;
