<strong>Zoovy Inc. Websites are the First to Provide Worry Free Shopping with a Guarantee</strong><br>
San Diego, CA<br />
<p>June 1, 2006 -- San Diego -- Zoovy, Inc. (www.zoovy.com), a leading provider of web stores and automated online selling systems, announces today the first virtually risk-free web storefronts. This technology  solves the biggest problem facing online merchants and shoppers today—knowing who to trust.</p>

<p>Zoovy solves this major problem by enabling its customers to bond their transactions with buySAFE, a leading online trust and safety company.  The bond offers broad financial protection up to $25,000, and assures that the buyer will receive their purchase exactly as it was described by the seller. Bonding increases web sales by bringing an unmatched level of security to the online consumer. Until now, this peace of mind was only available from select merchants on online auction sites such as eBay and Overstock Auctions. </p>

<p>Shoppers can recognize bonded websites by the reputable buySAFE Seal, a graphical verification that the seller has passed the buySAFE Business Inspection. This ensures that the merchant is trustworthy and reliable.</p>

<p>&quot;This functionality will allow online merchants the ability to gain the trust they deserve, leading to increased sales and happier customers,” said buySAFE CEO Jeff Grass. “Our service has had a tremendous effect in auction marketplaces, leading to increased sales and higher bids. We are excited to now bring this success to website stores, as there is a large demand for it. As an experienced and reliable leader in the ecommerce industry, Zoovy is an excellent company to pioneer this service.&quot;</p>

<p>Online stores from Zoovy are the only websites that currently have this capability.&quot;We strive to provide our store owners with the best technology available to enhance buyer trust, which in turn increases sales,&quot; said Zoovy CEO David Steel. &quot;Many high quality small to mid-sized merchants lose sales to big name companies as buyers just aren’t sure who to trust. Zoovy’s bonded websites solve this problem by giving buyers a credible guarantee on their purchases. We are thrilled to provide this highly beneficial technology to our storefront owners. Integrating with buySAFE will provide shoppers the trust they need, leading to an increase in sales for our Bonded Sellers.&quot;</p>
