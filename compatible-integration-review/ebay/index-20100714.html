<p>With Zoovy, you can easily launch your product into eBay, eBay Motors or your eBay Store.  Launch items one at a time or use our power listing tool to automate launching/relaunching and let the inventory system stop launching when needed.</p>
			

<h2>Use eBay to increase your sales in your store.</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Inventory management of your powerlisters</h2>
