Shopping’s goal is to create the most comprehensive list of products on the Web. <br><Br>
<h2>Reach More Customers</h2>
Millions of shoppers use Yahoo! Shopping to browse or search for the items they need. Integration with Yahoo! Shopping allows online sellers to reach consumers who are actively searching for their products. It can also be used to expand merchants’ online marketing campaigns.
<h2>Yahoo’s popularity</h2> 
"In the online shopping space, there's been a rise of comparison shopping sites," said Rob Solomon, vice president Yahoo Shopping. "We think the best shopping sites will have advanced features. You have to be comprehensive."
