<p ><strong>Quickbooks Integration</strong></p>
<p >Zoovy fully integrates with Quickbooks 2003 Pro/Premier and higher. As one of our partners, Quickbooks provides
	full support, resulting in seamless integration.</p>
<p ><strong>One Step Export</strong></p>
<p >With Zoovy&rsquo;s Quickbooks integration, there is no need to cut and paste&mdash;duplicate entry is eliminated.
	The integrated platform allows you to:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in;" type="disc"> <li >Print shipping labels</li><li >Export sales data</li><li >Track
invoices</li><li >Track customers </li><li >Monitor P&amp;L </li><li >Manage online
storefronts and auctions</li></ul>
<p ><strong>Save Time and Improve Accuracy</strong></p>
<p >As Quickbooks syncs with your Zoovy-powered operation, record keeping is optimized and errors are minimized,
	if not eradicated. Your business can save at least 10 hours per week in data entry time.</p>
<p ><b>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be in business without Zoovy.</b> I was selling so many scales that I couldn&rsquo;t keep
	track of it all myself. Now I spend maybe two hours a day in the software: the rest of the time I can run my business. The combination
	of Zoovy and Quickbooks is amazing in terms of time savings.&rdquo; &ndash; Ed Walker, Owner, Scales USA</p>
