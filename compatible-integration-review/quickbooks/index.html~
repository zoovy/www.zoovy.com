	if not eradicated. Your business can save at least 10 hours per week in data entry time.</p>
<p ><b>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be in business without Zoovy.</b> I was selling so many scales that I couldn&rsquo;t keep
	track of it all myself. Now I spend maybe two hours a day in the software: the rest of the time I can run my business. The combination
	of Zoovy 1 and Quickbooks is amazing in terms of time savings.&rdquo; &ndash; Ed Walker, Owner, Scales USA</p>
