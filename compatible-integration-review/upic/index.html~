<h2>Insure Your Package With U-PIC</h2>
<p>To help alleviate the high costs of carrier insurance, Zoovy has formed a strategic partnership with U-PIC Insurance services. U-PIC is an insurance provider offering full coverage for packages shipped through most major carriers, while offering substantial discounts ranging up to 80% off competitor pricing.</p>

<p>U-PIC has a dedicated staff with over nineteen years experience in application and claims processing, and have been a partner of the United States Postal Service for many of those years. By utilizing a streamlined insurance program with U-PIC, Zoovy merchants can eliminate unnecessary carrier trips, as well as non-revenue producing tasks from employees.</p>

<h2>Why Use U-PIC?</h2>
<p>"Why pay the high cost of carrier provided insurance, when you could just ship with the carrier and insure your package with U-PIC at a discount. We provide substantial savings on insurance for shippers using UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL and most other carriers. And there are no minimum requirements. Whether you ship hundreds of packages a day or just want to insure that special package once a year, U-PIC has a program to meet everyone’s needs." - U-PIC Representative</p>

<h2>Easy Startup</h2>
<p>After filling out a Request To Provide Coverage form, a U-PIC qualified sales respresentative will contact you to answer any questions you may have about their company and what program will best suit your needs. You will then receive a policy along with a supply of claim forms shortly after your request has been evaluated and approved for coverage. Then, you simply stop declaring value with the carrier and start saving with U-PIC. It's that's easy!</p>
