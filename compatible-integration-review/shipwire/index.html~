<h1>Shipwire storage and fulfillment solution</h1>
<p>Shipwire lets you focus on growing your business by removing the hassles of storage &amp; shipping.</p>

<h2>What is Shipwire?</h2>
<p>Shipwire is a leading order fulfillment service that allows you to store merchandise in massive East and West Coast warehouses in the U.S. and Toronto, Canada. Shipwire can easily be connected to your shopping cart or payment solution. As customers order from your online store, Shipwire will pack and ship it for you. It is that simple.</p>

<h2>Why do I need Shipwire?</h2>
<p>Grow your business and save yourself a lot of headaches. Without an order fulfillment service you must work long hours or hire employees to manage order fulfillment, packaging and inventory receiving. That takes a lot of time and money. Instead, focus on growing your business, and let Shipwire handle storage and shipping.<br>
</p>
<h2>How does Shipwire compare to hiring employees?</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re just starting out, or looking for a better way to manage your shipping and handling, Shipwire offers an easy and quick way to outsource shipping with no startup, receiving, storage or packaging fees.</p>

<p>The alternative to Shipwire is hiring employees. Hiring takes longer, is a headache, won&rsquo;t scale during your busy season and typically costs more when you consider salary, overhead, benefits and insurance. Be careful, hiring can give you the illusion of more control, if you have the time to train and manage them.</p>
