Online shoppers often start with Google. Our search advertising program, AdWords, helps them find you through targeted text ads that appear beside Google search results. And Google Product Search, our shopping search engine, allows shoppers to specifically search for and find products they want to buy.

<p><img src="//checkout.google.com/seller/images/adwords_ad.gif" alt="AdWords ad" width="258" height="146" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;"> Now, with Google Checkout you can add the Checkout badge to your AdWords ads and Product Search listings to highlight your store. The badge is an icon that tells potential customers that shopping with you will be convenient and secure.</p>
<p>Checkout also helps you more effectively turn your traffic into paying customers. Lengthy checkout processes frustrate online shoppers who then frequently abandon their shopping carts. With Google Checkout, the purchasing information of each Checkout user is stored in a single account, so they can buy from you by simply providing their username and password.</p>

<p>When using Google Checkout, you can sell with complete confidence. Google Checkout's industry-leading fraud protection program keeps you safe from fraud while helping you lower costs and increase sales. Here's how:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li style='margin-bottom:10px;'><b>Guaranteed Payment:</b> Checkout's Payment Guarantee protects 98% of Checkout orders on average -- when an order is guaranteed, you get paid      even if it results in a chargeback.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:10px;'><b>Free Protection:</b> While merchants are typically charged for fraud protection services, Google's comprehensive protection is free.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:10px;'><b>Lower Fraud Costs:</b> Checkout's fraud detection systems reduce fraud and manual review costs by proactively filtering out fraudulent orders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:10px;'><b>More Sales:</b> The same systems also help increase sales by identifying legitimate orders that you might otherwise mark as fraudulent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:10px;'><b>Fair Treatment:</b> Unlike other services that immediately deduct funds from you for chargebacks, Google does so only after a decision has been made as to who is at fault.</li>
</ul>
