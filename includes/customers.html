All of a sudden I was exposed to a much greater marketplace. My company sales seemed to double every year, and last year I did half a million in sales.',

			'The foundation of our business depended on being able to keep track of what we had through automation, rather than manually decrementing and incrementing inventory. At that point, about 3 years ago, we surveyed the top e-commerce systems and decided to give Zoovy a try. The core concept of Zoovy, having a unifi ed back-end serving a number of different syndication methods like eBay, Amazon, Overstock, BizRate, as well as a website, is the only way to go. I can&rsquo;t imagine having a website without the multi-site capability that Zoovy has.',

Last year in 2007 we were just slightly shy of 1 million dollars in sales. That&rsquo;s a huge jump considering we only started 3 years ago. I went from 100% Ebay sales down to only 20%. 80% is through my Zoovy store plus I nearly doubled my sales thanks to Zoovy Syndication.',

			qq~Just to let you know, I get more compliments on our site then I ever have.  I'm so proud of it and we've come a long way since moving over to Zoovy!~,
			qq~We launched on April 9th and have been able to implement a ton of extras, and syndications since then.  I know that this was time consuming, and I thank you all!~,
