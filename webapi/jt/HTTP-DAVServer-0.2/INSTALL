INSTALL NOTES FOR HTTP::DAVServer
--------------------------------------

Install this module as usual

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test      # there are no tests
 make install

WARNING! WARNING! DANGER! DANGER!

  This code intends to manipulate the contents of your file system based on HTTP requests.
  The code executes as your CGI user (often "nobody"). Make sure you backup ALL important data
  on your server. Due to unknown bugs on my part or misconfiguration of your server on your part
  this code coulde delete, move, or alter any files on your machine unintentionally.

  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED and by proceeding beyond this stage you agree that you won't blame, whine,
  complain, flame or otherwise point your finger at me for any unintentional consequences 
  of using this code.

/WARNING! WARNING! DANGER! DANGER!

With that dire message out of the way ...


To try your hand at running this via Apache** you will need to:  

    ** configuration of other servers is welcome - please supply description and/or screen shots

 a - copy "nph-req" to your cgi directory; check the path to Perl and make sure it is executable

 b - See docs in HTTP::DAVServer::AuthDigest for some notes about authentication options...

 c - add the following directives to relevant section of your httpd.conf

   Script PROPFIND  /cgi-bin/nph-req
   Script PROPPATCH /cgi-bin/nph-req
   Script MKCOL     /cgi-bin/nph-req
   Script DELETE    /cgi-bin/nph-req
   Script COPY      /cgi-bin/nph-nph
   Script PUT       /cgi-bin/nph-req
   Script MOVE      /cgi-bin/nph-nph
   # Script LOCK      /cgi-bin/nph-nph   ; LOCK and UNLOCK aren't even considered at this point
   # Script UNLOCK    /cgi-bin/nph-nph
 
   # Script OPTIONS   /cgi-bin/nph-req   ; My version of Apache doesn't seem to pass OPTIONS via script
   Header set DAV "1"                    ; so I set this output header explicitly instead

Then you should be able to try it out with your favorite DAV client ...

If things are failing mysteriously then add to nph-req before handle is called:

  $HTTP::DAVServer::WARN=1;
  $HTTP::DAVServer::TRACE=1;

Maybe there will be more info as to what is happening / blowing up.



A very very useful testing tool for WebDAV is litmus

 http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/

I use it a lot - but tests still fail while I work on the code.
