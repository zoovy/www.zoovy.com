Contact me - jlawrenc@cpan.org - to have me add things to my HTTP::DAVServer todo list. :)

much of this code is proof of concept and partial transition from my scratch code. I am really
open to any input at this point!


Rough points:

a - PROPPATCH - doesn't do anything / partially responding

b - LOCK / UNLOCK - not done

c - Make decisions on where to stuff things currently as package vars (ROOT, HOST, etc.)

d - improve subclassability

e - mod_perl support
