<div class="say">
<br>
I'm sorry, but the support team is currently unavailable. <br>
<br>
I can update an existing ticket, create a new support ticket, or notify
operations if this matter is an emergency. <br>
How may I assist you?

<div class="hint">
<i>When our support team follows up with clients - we receive *A LOT* of complaints from frustrated callers who say:<br>
"I ALREADY EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE --- WHY DO I HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN? WHY ISN'T IT ALREADY FIXED?"<br>
<br>
Creating a support ticket which says "Call XYZ @ ###-###-####" is insufficient for us to diagnose their issue.
Please help us avoid situations where they already explained the problem to you and we have no detail.<br>
<br>
The client will WANT to explain the whole issue to you in hopes you will be able to fix whatever is happening.<br>
<br>
If you listen to their problem, then you need to take good notes, and be sure to ask for examples, 
otherwise just <b>politely explain to the client that you an answering service - and all you have access to do is
create a support ticket for them</b>.
