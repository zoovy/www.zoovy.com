<b>Emergency Message:</b><br>
<div class="say">
<br>
I will need to place you on hold while I start calling the operations staff.<br>
<br>
I will keep calling until I reach somebody who can assist you, all the way up to the CEO if I need to.<br>
<br>
I need to make you aware that there will be a $250 charge applied to your account if the matter
is determined to be either your fault, or a non-emergency.<br>
<br>
Most electronic tickets are answered in 1 business day or less.<br>
<br>
Do you still want me to do this?<br>

<li> <a href="index.cgi?VERB=SUPPORT">No - create a regular technical support ticket.</a><br>
<li> Yes - this is an emergency (use Emergecy Action steps below)

<div class="hint">
<i>[[HINT: 
As a matter of policy we don't charge clients the $250 fee, except when they abuse this service.
<br>
<br>
Small business owners (our customers) tend to believe "everything is an emergency" 
so the //threat of being billed// is important -- otherwise even the most trivial issue would 
always be filed as high priority. <br>
<br>
Please don't share this policy with clients, but also please don't discourage them from 
failing to report *REAL* emergencies where they can't accept or process orders.
