					<h3>We're Different</h3>
					<span class="old_way">
						<h4>The Old Way</h4>
						<p>In the past, one of the biggest challenges in growing a successful online business was choosing the appropriate technology for your business needs. For many, it was a difficult choice because merchants had to do it first, locking them into the way that technology worked, not the way the merchant wanted to. Merchants soon found that the solution they chose was either too limited to allow them to grow, or too complicated to get up and running efficiently.<br/><br/>
						Being locked in to a specific, one-size fits all technology was not very conducive to businesses that needed to set themselves apart and do things differently. They soon found that if they wanted to grow, they would need to spend a lot of time, resources and money to take the next big jump. 
						</p>

					<span class="apps">
						<h4>Apps Are Where It's At</h4>
						<p>With Zoovy's app-based commerce framework, your stores are now custom tailored to your business needs.

Your store is designed to accomodate iterative updates, allowing you more flexibility as your business grows.</p>

					<span class="apps_provide">
						<h4>Apps provide:</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>an enhanced user experience for your customers</li>
						<li>lower operating costs.</li>
						<li>customization and flexibility (websites have severe limitations).</li>
						<li>quicker time to market - apps take weeks, websites take months.</li>
						<li>deployment options and flexibility.</li>

						Build It and They Will Buy<br/><span style="font-size:22px;">(... and have a better experience!)</span>

					<p>At the center of your e-commerce universe is your DataFair, consisting of your business information and your custom apps. But you need to get your apps built and your business information installed, right? We have you covered. Say go, and our project manager will build a team of experts who will help you get up and running quickly and efficiently.<br/><br/>
					Our designers, developers and testers are chomping at the bit to work on your apps. Just let us know what you need and we'll get our best and brightest to build it for you. Or, you can have your own team build your apps. We have standards and guides for them to go by. Just know that they will be held to the same standards and will undergo the same vigorous testing as the apps we build do.<br/><br/>
					Your app will start at the DESIGN stage, move to the DEVELOPMENT stage, and then proceed to the TESTING stage. Expect there to be 2-4 rounds of this process until your app is ready for prime time.

							</ul></p>
							<p>Zoovy will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this provision.</p>

						<h4>23. SEARCH ENGINE POLICY</h4>
							<p>Zoovy test sites are all hosted under the "ZOOVY.COM" domain name, and using IP addresses assigned to Zoovy by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). 
							Some search engines may not distinquish that each site is separate and therefore the actions of one customer, can affect all customers. For this reason Zoovy has developed a 
							strict policy regarding Search Engine "Spamming" techniques. 
							Customers are explicitly prohibited from:<ul>
								 <li>Cloaking - creating deceptive pages which attempt to trick search engines into giving higher ranking.</li>
								 <li>Writing text or creating links that can be seen by search engines but not by visitors.</li>
								 <li>Participating in link exchanges for the sole purpose of increasing your ranking in search engines.</li>
								 <li>Sending automated queries to Google in an attempt to monitor your site's ranking.</li>
								 <li>Use programs that generate lots of generic doorway pages.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>24. COMMERCIAL EMAIL - SPAMMERS BEWARE</h4>
							<p>The Zoovy system routinely sends commercial email on our customers behalf. Email sent by Zoovy is compliant with all Internet mail standards, and clearly designates "ZOOVY.COM" as the MTA (Message Transfer Agent). Zoovy has agreements with several major ISPs to ensure email originating from our mail servers is not treated as UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email/SPAM).</p>
							<p>While Zoovy does not monitor the actual content of messages, Zoovy does dictate the possible origins, and formatting of messages transmitted - including both the header and body content. This includes (but is not limited to) how opt-out and unsubscribe links are presented to recipients, along with what merchant identifiable information is transmitted to recipients. Zoovy has taken steps to ensure our email formats are compliant with the guidelines set forth by both the Federal CAN-SPAM ACT of 2004 and the postmaster guidelines for the respective ISPs we work with. </p>
							<p>In accordance with our polices Merchants must agree that any written, electronic, or verbal request by a customer to be unsubscribed must be acted upon within 24 hours - across all merchants marketing campaigns - even those not hosted by Zoovy. Merchants agree not to auto re-subscribe customers who have requested to be removed unless they can prove they have received an authentic request to opt-in the customer. </p>
							<p>In addition any attempt to tamper with the email formats developed by Zoovy such as (but not limited to) including concealing information, including deceptive information (such as false addresses / phone numbers), re-opting in customers who have opted-out, or ignoring opt-out requests will be result in immediate, irrevocable termination of the merchants account, along with complete forfeiture of the merchants data, forfeiture of any dues paid to Zoovy, in addition to any fees later assessed by Zoovy for disruption of service. Upon such an event Zoovy may (in it's sole discretion) share the merchants contact information, sales history, and any other information it deems relevant with any requesting ISP, or government agency upon written or electronic request.</p>

<!--

BELOW FOLLOWS AN EXAMPLE 'PAGE', INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER SYNTAX FOR INTEGRATION INTO THE SITE

-->
		<div id="example">
			<!-- The 'page' must begin with a script tag designating the pageAlias for URI parsing- this is important for parsing arrival links as well as intrasite links -->
			<!-- If the 'page' needs any customized transition, init, or destroy functions, they may be defined in this tag as well. -->
			<script type="text/javascript">
				//app.pageAlias["/somelocation.html"] = "idOfEnclosingDiv"
				app.pageAlias["/example.html"] = "example";
				
				/*
				The below object (optional), which must be named the same as the id of the enclosing div, just as the pageAlias is set that way,
				will contain any custom functions that will need to be specified for the page.  Any of these functions that are not customized
				will be set to the default functions specified at the top of this file.  There are 4 possible functions that can be defined:
				
				init
					Any code that needs to be executed by the page after it loads.  This includes setting up any animations that will occur on the page,
					any ajax that needs to be loaded, RSS feeds that need to be set up, etc...
					NOTE: any intervals that are set can be stored with the syntax app.currentIntervals.push(setInterval(...)); -- This will allow
					the default destroy function to clean them up appropriately.
					NOTE: init() will execute every time a page is loaded, regardless of whether it has previously been shown or not. The developer must
					take care to not re-execute code that does not clean itself up -- for example if an RSS feed is loaded in init and populates a feed viewer
					on the page, and that feed viewer is not emptied in destroy, the init() should check to see whether it has already been loaded.
				destroy
					Any code that needs to be executed to 'destroy' the page- this is mostly intended to clean up any repeating animations that are set
					in init, so that there are not a growing number of intervals executing, slowing down the JS engine.  In most cases this can be accomplished
					by simply leaving the default destroy function, as long as any intervals set in init() are pushed to the app.currentIntervals array.
				transitionIn
					Custom code to transition the page into view. Takes one parameter, the jquery selected page to be transitioned in.  The default function 
					fades in the page over the course of 1 second.  The transitionIn function should return the number of milliseconds that the transition process
					takes in order to properly deal with delays.
					NOTE: The developer should be careful of any specified transitions in, to specify them within the context of the page.  For example,
					$('p').slideRight(500);
					VS.
					$('p',$page).slideRight(500);
					The first will make all paragraphs in the entire DOM slide into view from the left, while the second will make all those on the transitioning page
					slide in instead.
				transitionOut
					As with the transitionIn function, except for leaving the page.  The developer much ensure the transitionOut delay is returned accurately, as this
					can cause major problems if it is not specified.
				*/
