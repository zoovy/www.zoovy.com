<h2>PowerReviews Express helps you:  </h2>
<p><strong>Increase conversion</strong>  <br />
  Recent studies show that customer reviews can increase sales, decrease returns, and improve customer confidence in buying online. And a whopping 83% of consumers say product reviews influence their purchasing decisions. (Opinion Research Group, July 2008)  </p>
<p><strong>Boost sales 
  </strong><br />
  While reviews are clearly a powerful tool for your site, not all reviews solutions are created equal. PowerReviews Express is the same robust solution used by Staples, Toys "R" Us, and REI. And it recently won the 2009 Best Site Merchandising Tool Award from Small Business Computing Excellence in Technology.  </p>
<p><strong>Build customer confidence
  </strong><br />
  For a low monthly fee, Zoovy merchants get a robust customer reviews solution with a full set of innovative features that keep shoppers on your site and help them make purchase decisions. For instance:
  <br />
  <ul><li>"Verified Buyer" badges build online shopper confidence with more credible reviews</li>
  <li>"Review Snapshot®" is an at-a-glance review summary that streamlines the research process for online shoppers</li>
  <li>Plus, shoppers read specific pros, cons, and best uses as well as how reviewers use a product</li></ul>
