<p><strong>Zoovy enables you to gain full control over your inventory with powerful common inventory functions</strong></p>

<div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><img src="images/inventory_diagram-581x265.gif" width="581" height="265" alt='Inventory Control' border='0' /></div>

<p>Separate sales channels pull their inventory and product information from one database which remains up-to-date in real time, avoiding the need to track multiple sets of inventory.</p>

<p>Items flagged for sale on auction sites are automatically reserved in your inventory so they don’t accidentally get sold by another
	sales channel.</p>

<p>Control product levels with 'Low stock' or 'Out of stock' automatic warning messages and other customizable rules that allow you to have faith in your inventory reports no matter how complex your sales model.</p>
