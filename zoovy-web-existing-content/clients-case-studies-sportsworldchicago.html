	<h3>The Client </h3>
	
	<p>SportsWorldChicago began in 1976 as a brick and mortar store across from Wrigley Field in Chicago. In 2000, a Web store was opened. Owner Brad Rosen employs about 20 people for his brick and mortar and Web store combined – and runs multiple retail sites in addition to SportsWorldChicago including BlackhawkShop, NYDugout and ChitownFootball. These sites supply fan apparel for the Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bears and Chicago Blackhawks sports teams. Between these sites, Rosen has more than 4,000 SKUs.</p>
	
	<h3>Objective</h3>
	
	<p>Prior to 2007, Rosen was using a proprietary e-commerce software solution that was not providing his products the exposure they needed. In 2007, Rosen began to look for a more effective, efficient solution.</p>
	
	<h3>The Challenge</h3>
	
	<p>With more than 4,000 SKUs and multiple sites, Rosen was looking for a robust e-commerce platform that contained all the bells and whistles necessary to make his sites more successful without sacrificing time and resources.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to quality e-commerce software, Rosen was seeking a partner that he could rely on to adapt quickly to the ever-changing demands of the online retail industry. A partner that would work eagerly with him to provide the best overall experience – from marketing to graphic design to search engine optimization. In 2007 Zoovy became that partner.</p>

	<h3>The Zoovy Solution</h3>
	<h4>Integrated syndications</h4>
	</hgroup>
	
	<p>Thanks to Zoovy's seamless syndication, Rosen can load his products once, make changes, sell them across each of his sites and automatically syndicate them out to all of the major e-tail outlets at the click of a button. Any time a hot new syndication begins to emerge or an existing syndication makes infrastructure changes, Zoovy's staff is on top it, allowing Rosen to not miss a beat. Because Zoovy has customer service teams who specialize in each major syndication, including Amazon and eBay, integration and problem solving are especially effective and simple.</p>
	
	<h4>Increased Product Exposure</h4>
	
	<p>Zoovy's marketing and Web support teams work to ensure Rosen's products receive the greatest exposure possible with regards to Google – metatags, meta descriptions, title tags, SEO. When search engines analyze the site content it must be organized for them to know what the site is about and what products it contains. Any necessary changes to the site are made quickly by Zoovy so Rosen's products continue to receive maximum exposure – a critical process for any online business.</p>
	
	
	<q>With Zoovy, I don't have to go into each site to submit a product. I simply upload a product, check the boxes for the sites on which I want them to appear, and they are automatically syndicated. Zoovy's seamless syndication makes my life so much easier.</q>
