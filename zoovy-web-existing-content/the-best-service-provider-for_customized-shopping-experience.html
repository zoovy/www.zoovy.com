<h2>By personalizing your Web store for return customers, you can boost conversion rates.</h2>
<p>Like a stock upgraded from hold to buy, Web store shoppers become infinitely more valuable when they go from browsers to purchasers. They obviously like what you’re offering, trust you as an e-commerce merchant and view your prices as competitive. That makes them prime candidates to become repeat customers.
<br /><br />
With that in mind, it’s important that when return customers log in they receive the full VIP treatment. This can be done in a number of ways using the Zoovy Complete platform, all of which have a proven history of increasing sales. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom greetings. “Hello, CUSTOMER NAME HERE.”</li>
<li>Personal messages indicating familiarity with the customers’ buying history. “We hope you enjoyed NAME OF YOUR LAST PURCHASE.”</li>
<li>New product suggestions. “Here are some other items we think you might be interested in.”</li>
<li>Cross-sell recommendations. If the customer bought an electric guitar, you can offer deals on associated products such as a guitar carrying case or an amp.</li>
</ul><br />
<h2>Profiting from Personalization</h2>
<p>Successful e-commerce sites strongly encourage return customers to log back in to an account. This allows for data harvesting, so Web store owners can track who’s coming back to their site and how often. It also makes it possible to organize the information needed to build valuable behavior profiles based on shopper interests and buying habits. The more information you have on customers, the better you can customize their experience. That translates to increased sales. 
<br /><br />
How does customizing work? Let’s say, for instance, the buyer has a history of looking at retro clothes. If they log in to your Web store, you can create a template that routes them to a page with retro items. This is a win-win. Good for you, good for them.
<br /><br />
<h2>Making it Easy </h2>
<p>Of course, some customers may resist logging in because it’s an extra step and it requires them to share information. So you need to point out the major benefit to them: Ease of use. By logging in, they don’t have to hassle with resubmitting their name, address, credit card, etc. to make a purchase.</p>
<br />
<h2>Leveraging Facebook, Twitter and Other Social Media</h2>
Facebook and Twitter are huge – and free. So use them to your benefit. With Zoovy’s advanced technology and skilled designers, you can provide customers a one-click option to share products that they like with Facebook friends and Twitter followers. Once a product goes viral to people in a similar social group, the profit potential for your business is limitless.
