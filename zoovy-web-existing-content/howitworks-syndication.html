<h2>Powerful syndication - more exposure for more sales opportunities</h2>

<p><strong>Products only sell when they are put in front of buyers. The more places you have your products listed, the more buyers are likely to see them.</strong></p>

<p>The powerful syndication tools in Zoovy allow you to simplify and automate the process of listing your products directly from your Zoovy web store  to multiple marketplaces, shopping comparison sites, Zoovy Multi-Sites and supply chain resellers.</p>

<p>Advanced scheduling and pricing rules let you control which products appear where, how much they sell for and how many of them will
	sell. The whole sales process is tied into your common product database which updates in real-time as products are sold. All sales
	come through your Zoovy checkout, maintaining all your orders and inventory control in one place.</p>
