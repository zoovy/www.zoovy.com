<h2>Growing an e-commerce business is all about leveraging customer data. But thereís a right way and a wrong way to do it. </h2>
<p>When it comes to the relationship between a Web merchant and their customers, nothing is more important than trust. The equation is pretty simple. Lose the customers' trust, lose their business.</p>
<br />
<h2>How do you lose a customerís trust? Letís look at three foolproof ways:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You bury them with an endless assault of promotions.</li>
<li>You arbitrarily use the order information they provided to send them marketing materials that donít have opt-out options.</li>
<li>You share their information. Sure, itís tempting to sell data, but do you really want your customers to know that theyíve got you to thank for all the Viagra e-mails theyíre suddenly getting?</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge, of course, is that thereís a very thin line between pushy and persistent. On one hand, you need to use the customer data youíve gathered to generate repeat business. But you canít throw everything at your customers and hope something sticks. Thatís a sure way to send them elsewhere.
<br /><br /></p>
<h2>So whatís the happy medium? Three proven strategies used by top merchants using the Zoovy Complete platform are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Encouraging customers to sign up for a newsletter containing the latest information on special offers, coupons, new products and sales events.</li>
<li>Providing customers with the targeted offers that are tightly focused around the products they have previously purchased.</li>
<li>Clearly stating their privacy guarantees so customers feel assured that their information wonít be sold or shared with other merchants.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>As with all promotional strategies, timing is important. Research done by Zoovy indicates that newsletters and e-mail offers are best presented during the checkout process because customers who buy from a Web store have already decided that the site is secure, trustworthy and the products are suited to their needs.
<br /><br />
Successful e-businesses understand the importance of tailoring promotional materials to fit the specific interests of their customers. And thatís where Zoovy Complete excels. Zoovy Complete's built-in Customer Relations Management (CRM) tools give merchants a competitive edge. Whether itís targeted e-mails, informative newsletters or valuable information on customer buying patterns, Zoovy Complete provides the secure, advanced marketing technology that merchants need to accommodate their customers, enhance the merchant-customer relationship and boost sales.
