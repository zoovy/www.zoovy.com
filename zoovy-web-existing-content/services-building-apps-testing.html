<p>Testing: Is it up to snuff?</p>
    
     <p>After the design and development stage are complete, the app is then subject to our vigorous testing protocol. Does it work on a desktop in a browser? We test for that. Does it work on the 20 different phones and 10 different tablets indicated? Yeah, we test for that too. We make sure it does everything it is supposed to do so that when you deploy it, it works.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&quot;We will release no app before its time&quot;&nbsp; </span></p>

     <p>On the first round, there are always things to be refined, fixed or changed. Items to be addressed will be directed to the appropriate team member to work on. Once that list is complete, it will return to the testing stage for another attempt to pass.</p>
