<h2>Zoovy's awesome success driven e-commerce services require a sponsor/referral from an already awesome existing client. </h2>
</p>
<p>

We have decided to focus our resources and energy towards growing revenue for existing clients. 
We no longer maintain an active sales organization, however our client services group will provide boarding costs and project estimates 
for new clients who have been sponsored by an existing client.
<br>

</p>
<p>

If you are already a client who was hoping to refer a friend, or family member just have them contact our
customer support line with your domain name and your individual sponsor code. 
Your sponsor code can be obtained by logging into your account and looking at the left hand corner of the screen.<br>

</p>
<p>

<br>
If you are not able to obtain a sponsorship we recommend: <a href="http://www.anycommerce.com?refer=zoovy">anyCommerce</a>
