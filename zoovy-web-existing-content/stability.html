A recent round of layoffs at Morrisville’s ChannelAdvisor didn’t hit only the company’s rank and file.

Four vice presidents got the axe from ChannelAdvisor, which laid off a total of 70 people after raising a new financing round of $20 million.

CEO Scot Wingo confirmed Internet reports that the affected veeps were Kevin Fitzgerald, head of U.S. sales; Jennifer Gibson, head of international sales; Ralph Kasuba, head of engineering; and Walter Goodlett, head of human resources.

<p><h1><a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/business/story/1263852.html" target="_blank">January 2009 - ChannelAdvisor Lays off further 19% of Workforce</a></h1>In September, the company had laid off 20 percent of its 350 employees. On Thursday, ChannelAdvisor laid off another 19 percent, a 35 percent reduction in total from its pre-September level. This week's cuts were made in departments across-the-board, with half occurring in the US and half in the UK and Australian offices.

Even with an additional $20 million in funding raised in September, Wingo said the second round of layoffs were necessary because "2009 is very hard to figure out what's going to happen." 
Customers were not notified of the layoffs ahead of time. Would they feel the   effects of a 35 percent reduction in staff in 4 months?</p><p><br /></p>
