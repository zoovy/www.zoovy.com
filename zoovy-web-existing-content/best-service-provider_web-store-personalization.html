<p>Deliver the right content to the right shoppers and increase your conversion rates with the web personalization options that come included in all Zoovy web stores as standard. </p>
<p>Simply delivering the same content to every customer means you are losing business. Over 98% of shoppers leave a web store without purchasing, so it's important to deliver content that is relevant to the customers browsing any web store to increase the possibility of a sale. </p>

<p>Zoovy's dynamic content delivery system actually builds web pages as your customers arrive at them allowing multiple decisions to be made about messaging, images, options, pricing and thousands of other variables in milliseconds. Tailoring the content of web pages and marketing efforts  allows a Zoovy merchant to ensure the content that is delivered to the customer is relevant to their needs, drastically increasing the opportunity to gain more sales. </p>
<p>Many third party web personalization services charge thousands of dollars a month and require lengthy, problematic and complex integrations before they can have any effect on a web store's conversion rates. </p>
