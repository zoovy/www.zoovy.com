<h3>What is Google Base? </h3>
<div style="border-top: 2px solid #C8D8EC;"></div>
<p>Google Base is a place where you can easily submit all types of online and offline content, which we'll make searchable on Google (if your content isn't online yet, we'll put it there). You can describe any item you post with <em>attributes</em>, which will help people find it when they do related searches. In fact, based on your items' relevance, users may find them in their results for searches on <a href="http://froogle.google.com" target="_blank">Froogle</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> and even our main <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google web search</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Google Base is currently available in English and German interfaces. </li>
	<li><strong> Reach:</strong> Items you submit to Google Base might be found on Google properties like <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://froogle.google.com">Froogle</a>, and <a href="http://maps.google.com"  target="_blank">Google Maps</a>. </li>
	<li><strong> How it's different:</strong> Google Base enables you to add <em>attributes</em> describing your content, so that searchers can easily find it. The more popular individual attributes become, the more often we'll suggest them when others post the same items. Similarly, items that become more popular will show up as suggested item types in the <strong>Choose an existing item type</strong> drop-down menu. </li>
