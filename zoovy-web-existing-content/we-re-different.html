     <p>The Old Way</p>
     <p>In the past, one of the biggest challenges in growing a successful online business was choosing the appropriate technology for your business needs. For many, it was a difficult choice because merchants had to do it first, locking them into the way that technology did business, not the way the merchant wanted to. Merchants soon found that the solution they chose was either too limited to allow them to grow, or too complicated to get up and running efficiently.</p>
