<h3>Merchants have the option to use Zoovy as a domain registar.</h3>

<br />
<h4>Benefits:</h4>

	<li>Added security, DNS can not be changed without Zoovy being aware</li>
	<li>Purchase domains directly through Zoovy interface</li>
</ul>


<h2>Zoovy becomes the registar, however merchant remains registered owner.</h2>
