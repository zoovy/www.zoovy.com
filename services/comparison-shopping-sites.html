<h1>Increase Sales with Comparison Shopping Sites!</h1>

<p>Zoovy makes it easy for merchants to increase exposure and visibility to shoppers with our automated product feeds for comparison shopping sites, sometimes referred to as shopping engines.  Simply choose the products and shopping engines with a click of the button.  The feeds are automated and have the ability to optimize product listings based on unique characteristics of each shopping site.  Zoovy runs products through a validation process that ensures the feed quality, allowing more products to get to shopping sites successfully.  Built in reporting helps determine how successful the shopping engines are based on performance.</p>



<p>Zoovy integrates and supports the top comparison shopping engines and continually adds emerging comparison shopping sites.   Whether it be Amazon Product Ads, Nextag, Pricegrabber, TheFind.com, or Google Products, Zoovy saves you time and money on the backend while making you money on the front.</p>
