<p>Zoovy simplifies and automates the process of listing products directly from a Zoovy web store to multiple marketplaces.   Our built in system lets you control which products appear where, how much they sell for, and maintain inventory in real time.  Orders and tracking information is also shared between Zoovy and the marketplace automatically.  Maintaining everything in one central location saves time and money. </p>

<p>Zoovy can provide live training for any marketplace integration assistance.</p>
