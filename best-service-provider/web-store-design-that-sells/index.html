<h1><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:40px; color:#666666; font-weight:400; line-height:50px">Web Design that Works for Today’s Shopper</span></h1>  
<h2>The right marketing plan will bring customers to your site; the right design will convert them into buyers. </h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, there is a web equivalent to a pushy salesman. It comes in the form of the over-eager Web store that uses every design trick in the book to win your business. The trouble is,  these tactics usually drive potential buyers elsewhere.</p>
<br />
<h2>Here are five common web design mistakes that shoo away customers rather than encouraging them to buy:</h2>


<p>1.<strong>Pop up windows:</strong> <br />
Annoying enough that all new browsers make a point of blocking them by default. If your message is important, give it a prominent spot on the page being viewed.</p>
<p>2.<strong>Flashing, blinking or oversized text:</strong><br /> 
Fine for Vegas but not for a web store. Use space around important headlines to lift them out of the page and make them easier to read.</p>
<p>3.<strong>Flash intros:</strong><br /> 
When this technology first came to market, it was like candy to graphic designers. But most of the time, it serves little purpose other than to distract potential customers’ from making a purchase.</p>
<p>4.<strong>Unreadable text:</strong><br /> 
Hard-to-see colors or text that’s placed on a busy background is sure to raise the frustration level of site visitors. Black text in a san-serif font on a white background is ideal for web pages.</p>
<p>5.<strong>Unnecessary type:</strong><br /> 
Don’t clutter your pages with fluff. When it comes to written descriptions of your product, focus on the relevant product features and benefits. Less is more.</p>
</ul>
<br />
<p><strong>The Cleaner the Better</strong><br />
Customers who visit your Web store want to learn about your product. The fewer distractions you throw their way, the easier it is for them to get the information they need. Remember, you spent time and money to get them to your site in the first place. Don’t lose them at the finish line.</p>
