<span class="head">Zoovy Terms of Service<br>
Last Updated: April 22nd, 2002</span><br>
<p><span class="subhead">1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</span>

<p>Welcome to Zoovy. Zoovy provides its service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. </p>

<p>You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: <a href='http://www.zoovy.com/legal/tos/'>http://www.zoovy.com/legal/tos/</a></p>

<p>In addition, when using particular Zoovy services, you and Zoovy shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS.</p>

<p><span class="subhead">2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</span></p>
<p>Zoovy currently provides users with access to a rich collection of on-line resources, including, various communications tools, software, online forums, shopping services, personalized content and branded programming through its network of properties (the "Service"). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Zoovy properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that Zoovy assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any communications or data. </p> 

<p>In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device. Please be aware that Zoovy has created certain areas that provide the ability to create adult or mature content. You must be at least 18 years of age to access and use such services.  </p>

<p><span class="subhead">3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</span>
<p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your company as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Zoovy has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Zoovy has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). Zoovy is not liable for any resulting loss of service due to untruthful or incomplete information. 
Zoovy is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly minors. For this reason, parents, or the legal guardian of minors who wish to allow their children access to Zoovy must agree to supervise, and otherwise completely indemnify Zoovy of any content the minor may come into contact with during operation of the Zoovy service. Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a mature business audience. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Services and/or Content (as defined in Section 6 below) are appropriate for your child. </p>

<p><span class="subhead">4. ZOOVY PRIVACY POLICY</span>
<p>Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy. For more information, please see our full privacy policy at

Thereafter, data transfer costs will apply depending on your account type - normally of $50 per Gigabyte traffic. <br>
<br>
Zoovy will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this provision.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="subhead">23. SEARCH ENGINE POLICY</span></p>
<br>
Zoovy sites are all hosted under the "ZOOVY.COM" domain name. 
Many search engines do not distinquish that each site is separate
and therefore the actions of one customer, can affect all customers. 
For this reason Zoovy has developed a strict policy regarding
Search Engine "Spamming" techniques. Customers are explicitly prohibited from:<br>
 <li> Cloaking - creating deceptive pages which attempt to trick search engines into giving higher ranking.<br>
 <li> Writing text or creating links that can be seen by search engines but not by visitors.<br>
 <li> Participating in link exchanges for the sole purpose of increasing your ranking in search engines. <br>
 <li> Sending automated queries to Google in an attempt to monitor your site's ranking. <br>
 <li> Use programs that generate lots of generic doorway pages. <br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span class="subhead">24. COMMERCIAL EMAIL - SPAMMERS BEWARE</span></p><br>
The Zoovy system routinely sends commercial email on our customers behalf.<br>
<br>
Email sent by Zoovy is compliant with all Internet mail standards, and clearly designates "ZOOVY.COM" as the MTA (Message Transfer Agent).<br>
<br>
Zoovy has agreements with several major ISPs to ensure email originating from our mail servers is not treated as UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email/SPAM).<br>
<br>
While Zoovy does not monitor the actual content of messages: Zoovy does dictate the possible origins, 
and formatting of messages transmitted - 
including both the header and body content. 
This includes (but is not limited to) how opt-out and unsubscribe links are presented to recipients, 
along with what merchant identifiable information is transmitted to recipients. 
Zoovy has taken steps to ensure our email formats are compliant with the guidelines set forth by both the 
Federal CAN-SPAM ACT of 2004 and the postmaster guidelines for the respective ISPs we work with. <br>
<br>
In accordance with our polices Merchants must agree that any written, electronic, or verbal request by 
a customer to be unsubscribed must be acted upon within 24 hours - across all merchants marketing 
campaigns - even those not hosted by Zoovy. Merchants agree not to auto re-subscribe customers who 
have requested to be removed unless they can prove they have received an authentic request to opt-in the customer. 
<br>
<br>
In addition any attempt to tamper with the email formats developed by Zoovy such as (but not limited to) 
including concealing information, including deceptive information (such as false addresses / phone numbers), 
re-opting in customers who have opted-out, or ignoring opt-out requests will be result in immediate, 
irrevocable termination of the merchants account, along with complete forfeiture of the merchants data, 
forfeiture of any dues paid to Zoovy, in addition to any fees later assessed by Zoovy for disruption of 
service. Upon such an event Zoovy may (in it's sole discretion) share the merchants contact information, 
sales history, and any other information it deems relevant with any requesting ISP, or government agency 
upon written or electronic request. 
<br>
<br>
<p><span class="subhead">25. GENERAL INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and Zoovy and govern your use of the Service, superceding any prior agreements between you and Zoovy. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. The TOS and the relationship between you and Zoovy shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Zoovy agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Diego, California. The failure of Zoovy to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. </p>

<p>The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  

<p><span class="subhead">26. VIOLATIONS</span></p>
<p>
Please report any violations of the TOS to our Customer Care group at <a href="mailto:support@zoovy.com">support@zoovy.com</a>.
