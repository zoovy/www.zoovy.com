	If you would like your e-mail or your website redirected to another
area. This is the place to do it. Here you will be able to take and have
your customer's e-mail from your Zoovy store, redirected to your home e-mail
address or your work e-mail address, or whatever you prefer. This will allow
you to receive your mail from anywhere in the world as long as you have
e-mail access. It does not matter what account you have you can just have
the e-mail redirected to you.
	If you are looking to expand your business and have purchased a URL
lately and would like the people that go to that site, redirected to your
Zoovy business, then you will have to enter the proper information here, in
the Domain name. This will allow all your traffic to go to your Zoovy store,
and then Zoovy can redirect your mail to you.
