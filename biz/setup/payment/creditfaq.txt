Orderrs being succesfully captured by my gateway are coming in to zoovy as
denied. Order 02-197 had to be changed from denied to paid manuely. I changed
my avs settings in  SETUP>PAYMENTS but I think im sacrificing security any
reason why this might be happening?

Unfortunately many gateways cannot filter based on AVS result. Zoovy offers the ability to filter by AVS result, in addition to actual processor result. 

Authorize.net can set transactions to pending when AVS fails (which is how you have it configured now).

In addition you should go into your authorize.net settings to configure authorize.net to simply deny transactions which do not meet your security requirement.
