HOWTO: Convert from a Paypal Cart to Zoovy

Zoovy has created a script which can translate the Paypal add to cart commands into Zoovy 
add-to-cart commands. Rather than re-creating each page, you only need to do a search and replace 
to migrate your entire site.

Steps:

1. Enable the Zoovy Developer Soft Cart option (be sure to enable Zoovy Developer as well!).
2. Use the search and replace function of your HTML Editor to replace the action="http://www.paypal.com/x-click/webscr" 
portion of your pages with the following text:
action="http://www.zoovy.com/webapi/paypal/hack.cgi/USERNAME=yourname"

be sure to replace yourname with your Zoovy username.
3. Thats it, you're done. The Zoovy script will automatically translate the Paypal cart parameters into the proper
Zoovy add-to-cart buttons.


Known Issues:
The Zoovy Cart will NOT translated fixed shipping from the Paypal cart.
It will instead use the Zoovy shipping that is configured in your store.
