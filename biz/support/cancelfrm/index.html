<b>Cancellation Policies &amp; Procedures:</b><br>
<br>
Cancellations will be effective on the effective date above, or up to 5 business days after the cancellation is received; 
whichever is later. 
Cancelled accounts will receive a final invoice for any outstanding fees or support charges, 
and may be subject to a 30 day cancellation window based on the policies below.
Clients are able to access order history until the effective date of the cancellation.
Any marketplace listings will be cancelled and associated listings will be cancelled and/or removed 
on the effective date.<br>
<br>
In the event the information on the cancellation form appears fraudulent, Zoovy reserves the right to contact 
the customer via phone or email to confirm that the cancellation is authorized. 
If we cannot confirm the authenticity then the cancellation request will be placed on hold. 
In any case the acknowledgement of the cancellation will be emailed within 5 business days of receiving the facsimile - 
if you do not receive an acknowledgement please email billing@zoovy.com.<br>
<br>

Monthly Billing: Per our billing policy any accounts that were live (conducted any online sales)
are subject to a "last month fee" to cover data retention. 
Zoovy will, at the merchant's option accept a forwarding email and/or phone number so that inbound customer 
requests can be routed.  This will remain in place for up to 6 months. <br>
<br>

<b>Refunds on Graphic Design/Data Formatting/Programming/Implementation:</b><br> 
During the course of a project Zoovy routinely shares trade secrets with our
clients which represent non-recoverable costs in the event of a project cancellation.
All graphic design, data formatting, and programming services provided by Zoovy are considered
ongoing hourly "consultation projects" - even if the final delivery is being provided at a fixed cost
(provided the project has stayed within it's predefined scope). 
Ultimate discretion about the scope of work, timelines, and approval of a project is
always made by our clients (unless they implicitly assign that authority to
Zoovy, and even then they have the option to rescind that authority.) 
During the course of a normal the project Zoovy routinely provides our clients
with education, assistance, expertise/advice, and feedback in a variety of business disciplines
that may be incorporated into the current or future projects.  
Therefore each of the services provided by Zoovy have tangible value and relevance at the
moment they were rendered.<br>
<br>
As such, if a customer chooses to terminate their service while projects are in progress, 
the client will be charged the hourly fees based on the time spent on the project and the remainder 
of any outstanding balance will be refunded.  A complete list of billing
services and fees can be found at http://webdoc.zoovy.com/doc/50551.
Zoovy often provides fixed price services at, or near our operating costs
in anticipation of increased monthly revenues. 
If a client terminates service within 6 months of the completion of a fixed price project
where the value of actual hours exceeded the fixed price cost then Zoovy may request 
client pay the actual project costs at our standard hourly rates.
If the scope of a fixed-price project has been altered during the course of the implementation
(without being converted into an hourly project), or if the project reaches LIVE (awaiting customer 
testing/feedback phase) the project shall be considered delivered and is not eligible for any refund.<br>
<br>

Customer receives rights to any design work, logos, programming, business methods, formatted data, 
program scripts, or other created works provided during the course of the project, except in cases where 
Zoovy was not reimbursed for the project costs, or other such agreement was made between the
parties, or in the event the derivative work was functionality designated as "CORE" and incorporated 
directly into the Zoovy.com platform.
Customer grants to Zoovy right to re-use any derivative work that it has created (except graphic design
elements) on future projects unless otherwise explicitly stated in the agreement.

<br>
<b>Refunds on Other Fees:</b><br>
Equipment is subject to a 25% restocking fee. 
Domain names registrations and transfers, and SSL Certificates, LiveChat licenses, 
PCI services/EV Certs, PowerReviews are not refundable under any circumstance. 
Fees charged by partners are not refundable (even if those fees are collected on behalf of the partner by Zoovy).<br>
<br>
<b>Domain Names</b><br>
Domain names must be transferred prior to termination of service. Any domain names not transferred will be considered 
abandoned and immediately become the property of Zoovy, Inc.
<br>
<b>Optional - Forwarding Message</b><br>
After a website is removed it is not uncommon for Zoovy to receive calls and emails from customers who 
have been planning to purchase or would like to know the status of their order, please include instructions 
for them to contact you:<br>
_______________________________________________________________________________________<br>
_______________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<i>If the section above is left blank, customers will be instructed that "No information is available, 
the merchant either cancelled, had their account disabled, or has gone out of business."</i><br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Refund/Billing Policies:</b><br>
Refunds are subject to the billing and customer service policies found at http://webdoc.zoovy.com/doc/51610.
Please refer to the contract for specific refund policies/exemptions that may supercede our standard policies. 
No refunds are given on setup fees after accounts have switched to live, and some accounts 
(such as those without design projects) are considered live the day they are provisioned. 
Refunds for the setup/provisioning fee on new accounts are granted according to the schedule below:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Received within the first 15 days</td>
		<td>A full refund of the provisioning fee.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
		<td>After day 15 days</td>
		<td>No refund of the provisiong fee.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
		<td colspan='2'><i>For non-live accounts the cancellation date is considered effective on the date the facsimile is received.</i></td>
	</tr>
</table>
If an account has done more than $1,000 in gross sales in the 90 days prior to receiving the cancellation, 
then Zoovy requires a 30 day advance cancellation notice. Customers who have not done $1,000 in gross sales are not 
subject to the 30 day cancellation period. No refund will be given for monthly service fees which were invoiced 
before the effective cancellation date. Monthly fees include availability of service/resources, disk space, backups, 
bandwidth, and support staffing allocation - absolutely no refunds will be given for invoices prior to the 
cancellation effective date.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Termination of Annual Agreements:</b><br>
Annual agreements must be terminated 30 days prior to their renewal date, unless otherwise specified in the agreement.
Customer is responsible for all monthly minimum fees associated with the entire term of their contract unless otherwise 
specified in their agreement.
<br>

<b>Records Retention Policy:</b><br>
Zoovy retains client records and all relevant communications for a minimum of six (6) months following the termination 
of an account. This policy has been established to demonstrate a "good faith" effort to accomodate both state 
and federal law-enforcement agencies, and to ensure compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP).
For this reason cancellations are effective only on the date they are received, or a later date (if requested).
Requests to retroactively cancel accounts will be rejected on this basis, and the cancellation will be 
processed effective the date it was received. Requests to access this data beyond the cancellation date will be 
subject to additional fees. Organizations who may be subject to additional data retention requirements such as HIPPA, 
SOX, or PCI/CISP should determine how this data retention policy affects them.<br>
<br>
<i>Acceptance of this policy is implicitly required by the terms of service outlined in all user agreements. 
Altering or tampering with this form without prior written consent by Zoovy does not negate
acceptance of the policies stated above. Cancellations performed by Zoovy (not at request of the customer) 
are also subject to these terms.</i>
