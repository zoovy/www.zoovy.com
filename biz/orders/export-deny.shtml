Sorry, the export feature requires a gold account.<br>
<br>
About this feature:<br>
The export feature allows you transmit you orders to a remote 
system for processing. Remote systems may include other Zoovy stores,
suppliers, or fulfillment centers. Export allows you to optionally
strip buyer payment and other non-relevent information before they
are transmitted.<br>
