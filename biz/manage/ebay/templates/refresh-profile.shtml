<b>This utility will go to eBay and update your active listings that were launched with 
profile <!-- PROFILE -->. A realtime status will be provided in this window as we proceed.</b><br>
<br>
Frequent Gotchas:<br>
<ul>
<li> Any changes you have made to the product OR the profile will be reflected when the item is refreshed 
<li> eBay may not allow revisions of certain listing such as those which contain feature downgrades, or those
items which have already been purchased or received bids. The system will try and implement the changes anyway
but you will receive an error message.<br>
<li> The profile which was selected when the item was *LAUNCHED* is the profile which will be used.
If you select an alternate profile for a product after an ebay item was created.
