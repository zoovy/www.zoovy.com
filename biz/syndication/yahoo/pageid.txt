Hello Kendall,

Thank you for writing to Yahoo! Store.

Special note for database users:

If you are using a CSV database to create the items in your Store, the 
page ID will have been created from your code field.  It is important to understand how the Store will create a page ID for your pages from the 
Code field so you can correctly name your images.  

As shown below, the Store can only create IDs that use letters, numbers 
and hyphens (dashes).  While the Code field can use nearly any 
character, when the ID is created, any character that is not a number, 
letter or hyphen will be converted to a hyphen in the page ID.


Examples:

   Code      --->   Page ID    --->   Image Name

   123abc           123abc            123abc.gif

   123 abc          123-abc           123-abc.gif

   123*abc          123-abc           123-abc.gif

   12 34#8-3        12-34-8-3         12-34-8-3.gif
