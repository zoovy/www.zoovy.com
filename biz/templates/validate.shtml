<b>How this system works:</b><br>
<br>
Both Zoovy and the legitimate partners that we work with have access to
generate valid authorization codes.
All Zoovy partners should do this before they contact you.
Anybody who claims to be representing Zoovy or in anyway affiliated with 
Zoovy and does not have a valid security code is lying. <br>
<br>
You should *NEVER* give anybody access to your store who you do not
implicitly trust. Virtually any amount of access can be exploited into
something which can literally destroy your business. For example even giving
a search engine optimization company access to tune keywords on your site - 
can let them also embed malicious code into your site that breaks into your 
customers computer, then intercepts and transmits the credit card numbers 
back to them. 
<br>
Malicious hackers are even using sophisticated telephone boiler rooms with
cracked VoIP phones to "social engineer" this information - it's nearly
untracable. A single store can often net them hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in revenue in just a few hours. 
Unfortunately it's a dangerous world we live in, you really can't be too 
paranoid.<br>
<br>
Authorization codes are unique to a Zoovy account and vendor combination, 
they are based on an algorithim that uses two independent shared secrets 
a long with a secret encoding algorithim making it impossible to guess or
share across accounts.<br>
<br>
Zoovy takes great care to ensure the legitimacy of our partners and their
offerings. Together Zoovy merchants form a strong community of intelligent
business owners that process millions of dollars in sales each month.
We encourage all our merchants to utilize this system - by doing 
this you protect the entire community - since hackers are less likely to
target our userbase if they believe most or all attacks will be thwarted 
and repeated.<br>
<br>
<i>Also - NEVER buy from a vendor who spammed you. Literally like 2 out of 3
are scams. Legitimate businesses do not send email spam - ever.</i><br>
<br>
Finally - as you are probably already aware links in emails can be forged. 
For this reason Zoovy and our partners will *NEVER* link to the validate script. 
The only way you should ever legitimately access the validate script is by
opening a new browser window and going www.zoovy.com, logging in, and
entering your username and password and then typing in the validation
code.<br>
